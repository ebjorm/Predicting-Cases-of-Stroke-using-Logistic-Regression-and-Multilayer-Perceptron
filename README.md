# Predicting-Cases-of-Stroke-using-Logistic-Regression-and-Multilayer-Perceptron
Project for Machine Learning course

The project lets you:
- practice the modelling of a real-life application as a machine learning problem
- apply basic ML methods discussed in the lectures and assignments
- practice the writing of a scientific report ("paper")

This project uses logistic regression and multilayer preceptron to predict the chanse of haveing a stroke.
The final project report that includes the code as an appendix can be found in the ML project.pdf
